# Tic-Tac-Toe
My first GUI project
This is a project I created in Java to learn how to use GUIs. I learned a lot considering I did this all from scratch and just looking up bugs/problems and the solutions to them that I came across on the internet. I'm not sure if there is a way to add feedback but I am more than happy to receive any! You can find me on LinkedIn @ www.linkedin.com/in/jacka02 or you can email me at jack.alexander20202@gmail.com for questions or feedback. Thank you for reading
1. I essentially initializedd my buttons and made a panel for them to sit inside of neatly. I then made a panel for the title.
2. Then I did all the variations of the game and thats about it.
Although the project looks cooler than the python Rock paper scissors, this one was definitely the easier of the two. The other one was a lot tougher especially since it was in a newer language for me. I'd already taken AP comp sci in highschool and used Java before so this was just a bit of an extension(haha see what i did there?)
